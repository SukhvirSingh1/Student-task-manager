# 🎓 Student Task Manager (Python + GUI + SQLite)

## 📌 Description
The **Student Task Manager** is a desktop application built using **Python**, **Tkinter**, and **SQLite**.  
It allows students to manage their academic tasks by adding assignments, setting due dates, and viewing all tasks in a simple graphical interface.

This project was created as a hands-on learning step to strengthen understanding of:
- GUI development
- Database integration
- Python class structure
- Real-world app logic

It represents a transition from beginner-level scripting to building structured, database-driven applications.
